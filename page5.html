                                <p>To help us understand some of this music theory stuff, we will set up a visual aid. The FL Studio Piano Roll is accessed by pressing <strong>F7</strong>. Once opened, you will see a sideways piano keyboard along the right side of the screen. If you press the spacebar you will see the bar go across the screen from left to right and then go back to the start. You will also hear the drums playing that we set up before.</p>
                                <p>You will notice the letter <em>C</em> on certain keys of the sideways piano. These indicate the note C, and each C is in a different octave, which is represented by the number next to the C. Octaves higher on the screen will sound higher, and octaves lower on the screen will sound lower. You can scroll up and down and click on the notes of the piano to get a sense for what is happening.</p>

                            <h3>Conceptual</h3>
                            <p>As mentioned before, <strong>notes</strong> are indicated by letters. In addition to C, letters A through G each have a corresponding note. Each of these letters representing notes are the white keys on a piano. The black keys are accents, we will not be working with accents in this tutorial. All of the white keys on the piano grouped together are called a <strong>scale</strong>. Typically if you play notes within a scale, you will make something that sounds good, or at the very least, coherent. A <strong>chord</strong> is a group of notes played together at the same time. Typically alternating notes within a scale will produce a chord.</p>

                            <h3>Practical</h3>
                            <p>In our case, we will be focusing on the white keys that line up with the piano roll. These notes make up the scale known as C Major. The same notes also make up the scale A Minor, but let's not get too crazy since we are just getting started.</p>
                            <p>We will create a four chord pattern that will loop alongside our drums. It will sound very simple at first, but you will get the feeling of accomplishment that comes with creating something.</p>

                            <p>Now it is time for us to create our own chord progression. This is where your song will really start to come to life. Musical notes is where emotion comes from in songs, and chords are a great way to set an emotional foundation for your track.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Find <em>C5</em> on the piano roll. Click next to it and a green block will appear. Drag this block all the way to the left, next to the piano roll. This is a note that will be played. You can press the spacebar to hear it.</li>
                                <li>Move your mouse cursor to the right side of the green block until arrows appear. Click and drag to the right until your block lines up with the line as shown in the picture below.</li>
                                <li>Click in another area above your green block. The note that the block is going to play is displayed. Click and drag the block up or down until it is on note <em>E5</em>. Do the same thing and place another block on <em>G5.</em> This is called a <strong>C Major chord</strong>. Hit the spacebar to hear it.</li>
                                <li>Follow the same steps to create the next 3 chords. The names of these chords are <strong>G Major</strong>, <strong>A Minor</strong>, and <strong>F Major</strong>. Reference the picture below to see which notes you will need.</li>
